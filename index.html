      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a 20-year-old computer science student from Cavite State University CCAT, originally born in Dubai, UAE. With a passion for technology and big dreams of becoming a successful software engineer, I dedicate 8 hours a day to my studies. My commitment to excellence is reflected in my trailhead account, where I've gained knowledge in Salesforce. As a student, I strive to be known for my unique mind and powerful insights, using words to share my computer-related knowledge in an easy-to-understand manner. My goal is to be recognized as the best student, consistently delivering unique and precise answers.In the pursuit of my goals, I immerse myself in the world of computer science, dedicating significant time to reading and watching movies for both relaxation and inspiration. I believe that being well-rounded contributes to a unique perspective, enriching my understanding of the subjects. Beyond the classroom, I am actively engaged in the Trailhead community, honing my skills in Salesforce, which I view as a valuable asset in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
    Balancing formal education with practical experience, I aim to stand out not just as a student but as a future software engineer. The combination of my academic endeavors, passion for technology, and hands-on experience positions me to achieve success in this dynamic field. I am on a journey to become the best version of myself, armed with a distinctive mindset and a determination to leave a mark in the world of software engineering.</p>
